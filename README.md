### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hodei!

![Computer Science](csc_elementary.png)

I am a Computer Engineer with a specialisation in Computing and Intelligent Systems from the Public University of Navarra and I also have a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Granada. In addition to this, I also have a degree in Video Game Development and Virtual Reality Applications, also obtained at the Public University of Navarra at the same time as my degree.

What I like most about my studies is Bioinformatics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning, that is, everything related to Artificial Intelligence, although I am also interested in Cybersecurity, Blockchain and new technologies related to Virtual and Augmented Reality. 

## Work Experience

### **Project Assistant** - ImitAI, Neuraptic AI and Public University of Navarre
_October 2021 - Nowadays_
* I have been working on finding out what is the best configuration of data (both visual and non-visual) needed by a model to perform industrial robotic tasks. 
* I have analysed different data generation and simulation frameworks in order to see which one is able to provide the most information when trying to perform real-world tasks in a virtual world.
* I have trained thousands of models using CNN, LSTM and other architectures with the goal of obtaining a model that is able to simulate a robotic task as accurately as possible in a virtual world.
* I have worked with virtual, synthetic (imitating as closely as possible the real data within the virtual world) and real data, being the latter the ones that I have analysed and evaluated before putting them into production in order to make the AI able to visualise them better, saving space and time.
* I have read and studied several scientific articles where they talk about different techniques and methods of application of Imitation Learning in order to be able to replicate them and carry them out through implementations of these. The main topic and object of study has always been Few-Shot and One-Shot Learning based on visual and non-visual data.

### **University Professor** - Public University of Navarre
_September 2022 - Nowadays_
* Theoretical and practical teacher in charge of the first year Computer Science subject taught to the Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Electrical-Electronic Engineering groups.

### **Programmer and Developer in AI Team** - DasNano/Veridas
_July 2020 - September 2020_
* Extracurricular internship during the summer where I performed tasks within different teams doing more work within the facial biometrics and artificial intelligence team.
